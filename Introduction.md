# Introduction #
<font color='#336699'>HORRO</font><font color='#ff9900'>Rss</font>**is a set of Java classes to parse RSS files. It works with simple objects (POJOs) which represents the main items of RSS files like "channel", "image", and "item".**<br><br>
At the beginning, the first aim was to be a parser as free as possible: free software and free of the propietary Java Sun's platform. In 2004 the only way to make a real free development with this language was with the <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/'>GNU Classpath</a> project. Nowadays, after Sun opened Java with <a href='http://openjdk.java.net/'>OpenJDK</a>, this only have sense if you want to compile to native code.<br>

<h2>Easy to use</h2>
<font color='#336699'>HORRO</font><font color='#ff9900'>Rss</font><b>transforms the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss'>RSS</a> files into Java objects to make easier the manipulation. In the documentation section you will find some <a href='SampleCode.md'>sample code</a>.<br></b><br><br>

<h2>Light-weight</h2>
The previous feature could have been done easily with the excellent project <a href='http://xstream.codehaus.org/'>XStream</a> but then we would introduce a lot of dependencies, turning heavier the project. <font color='#336699'>HORRO</font><font color='#ff9900'>Rss</font>
