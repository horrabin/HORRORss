=Introduction=
*<font color="#336699">HORRO</font><font color="#ff9900">Rss</font>* is a set of Java classes to parse RSS files. It works with simple objects (POJOs) which represents the main items of RSS files like "channel", "image", and "item". 
<br>
At the beginning, the first aim was to be a parser as free as possible: free software and free of the propietary Java Sun's platform. In 2004 the only way to make a real free development with this language was with the [http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/ GNU Classpath] project. Nowadays, after Sun opened Java with [http://openjdk.java.net/ OpenJDK], this only have sense if you want to compile to native code.

==Easy to use==
*<font color="#336699">HORRO</font><font color="#ff9900">Rss</font>* transforms the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss RSS] files into Java objects to make easier the manipulation. In the documentation section you will find some [SampleCode sample code].
<br><br>

==Light-weight==
The previous feature could have been done easily with the excellent project [http://xstream.codehaus.org/ XStream] but then we would introduce a lot of dependencies, turning heavier the project. *<font color="#336699">HORRO</font><font color="#ff9900">Rss</font>* only have one dependency, the [http://sparta-xml.sourceforge.net/ Sparta-XML] parser.
