*<font color="#336699">HORRO</font><font color="#ff9900">Rss</font>* is a set of Java classes to parse RSS files. It works with simple objects (POJOs) which represents the main items of RSS files like "channel", "image", and "item". 

The first aim of *HORRORss* was to be a parser as free as possible: free software and free of the propietary Java Sun's platform. In 2004 the only way to make a real free development with this language was with the [http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/ GNU Classpath] project. Nowadays, after Sun opened Java and the appear of [http://openjdk.java.net/ OpenJDK], this _feature_ may only have sense if you want to compile to native code.

The second aim was to be easy to use. HORRORss transforms the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss RSS] files into Java objects to make easier the manipulation. This feature can be easily done with the excellent project [http://xstream.codehaus.org/ XStream] but then we would introduce a lot of dependencies, turning heavier the project. HORRORss only have one dependency, the [http://sparta-xml.sourceforge.net/ Sparta-XML] parser wich is also compatible with [http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/ GNU Classpath].

So if you are looking for an RSS parser with these features, HORRORss is your project!
